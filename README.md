Dragon Quest Themed Twitter Bot

## About
I'm a big fan of the Dragon Quest series and thought it'd be a fun side project to create a Twitter bot themed around it. It's in no way affiliated with the series proper.

## Commands
To interact with the bot, simply @ it in a message with a hashtag command. Below are a list of the commands it currently supports.

* `#roll` Accepts a number of dice to roll and how many sides each should be in the form of `[num]d[sides]`.

## Contributing
Any and all contributions are welcome. Open a PR!

## Building
Requires .NET Core 2.1. Create a copy of appsettings.json file and name it appsettings.Development.json. You'll need to get your own copy of keys for the Twitter API and plug em in before you'll be able to test.
